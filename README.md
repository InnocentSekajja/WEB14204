# Designing the UX

This unit introduces you to the methods and tools used to effectively address the needs and circumstances of Web users, to design and produce Web interfaces that are comfortable and even joyful to use.

This includes:

* qualitative and quantitative user research 
* competitor analysis
* User eXperience (UX) design principles and patterns
* user personas, user stories and user journeys
* interface design: paper-prototyping and wireframing
* mobile-first web design
* rapid prototyping tools
* search engine optimisation
* user-testing: face2face, A/B testing and analytics
* motivational copy-writing for stickiness

## Brief

**Design the UX and build the prototype of a mobile-first Web product**.

This can be a **new product**, or the **re-design** of an existing product. 

The scope of your project will be evaluated in class, to make sure it is appropriate and realistic.

This project is about **how your Web product works and what is says**, what people (users) do with it, not just about how it looks. 

This unit is **not** about honing your coding skills, so whilst you are encouraged to code your prototype using HTML+CSS+JS, there are many tools that will get you to that end-result without touching code (or not too much of it).
