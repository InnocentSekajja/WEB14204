######About
Shabba is a single pro athlete who specialises in 100 meter runs. He travelled from Poland to England in 2013 to pursue his athletics career. He usually listens to music on his ipod usually set to shuffle mode. He is mostly acquainted with Polish music and would like to expand his library to include lots of English music.
