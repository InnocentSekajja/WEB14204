##The time is ripe for a new wave of niche social networks

I agree with motion that niche social networks are the future for social networks. Its true that on platforms like Facebook, while it’s very good for connecting with friends and finding out what people have been up to, I find that people posting hobbies like fashion, cooking, music tend to get the “pity likes”. This tends to be frustrating to the people who live and breath for their hobbies or interests. I believe that social networks designed for a specific type of people will be the social networks that take the frontline of social networks in the future.

As a musician, I am keen on seeing what other musicians are creating hence I think people sharing posts to people with similar interests will be “the thing to do”. Let's face it, everyone has an interest. Even 70 year olds have interests. So imagine a social network dedicated to 70 year old peoples interests? I bet every 70 year old with a smartphone and a good eye site would have that app on their phones.
 
The premise for creating niche social networks is so that people with similar interests can share posts with each other on a dedicated social network. And it's true that although some of these networks have less than 100,000 members, the members are active and this creates a very dynamic experience for the users.  

Time will tell going forward but I think we have to appreciate that FaceBook was the first social network to reach the global level it did.
