###### What is the main issue you're working on?
Initially,my issue was how to encourage new users to actually create content. I thought this was an issue because on initial creation of an account, the profile page is empty and I thought by the profile page being empty, the user was not being given inspiration to upload content. But after I analyzed the issue, I decided to change it and make it a little focused in relation to how users will interact with the app so my new issue is “How the app can encourage content creators to share uploaded content using the sharing features of the app and how content creators can be encouraged to upgrade to the pro plan in order to benefit from all full features of the app.”
######What are its causes?
The app is based around users sharing content. Whether original uploaded content or content from other profiles. If a new user like a musician uploads his/her music, the app has features that can help promote their music and hence boost their fan base. Some of these features include group sharing features where a content creator can share their music through “music groups”. Music groups are created by a community of content creators and content consumers. The music groups are genre based and have an admin that over sees what music is being shared in the group in order to make sure that the shared content stays true to the genre at hand. A content creator can share their content to a maximum of 40 groups. Users who are not content creators can share content from content creators through the add to playlist feature. This creates a folder on the user’s profile that contains music from other profiles on the app. The user is expected to name the playlist folders in order to make the playlists searchable on the app. The app also provides pro features where bands/musicians can benefit from features such as unlimited downloads,unlimited audio uploads, analytics that show who is listening to their music,number of page visits, countries of the people visiting the page and also the countries of the people playing their music. The app will also combine data to show a graph of countries with most visits to countries with least visits . This type of data will help the bands know where their fans are and will help them direct their promotional campaigns or know where to go on tour etc.
######What is its context?
Seeing that the app cannot do all these things on behalf of the user, I am planning to do research to try and find out how best to present these promotional and upgrade features to my app users.
