In preparation for next week's guest lecture, write a brief description of your social network concept, including the following information:

######Who is it for?
My app/social network concept is for music lovers and enthusiasts to music creators and profesionals.

######How does it work?

-Sign up either by email or Google and Facebook.

-If you sign up using Google or Facebook,the app extracts information that is music related i.e. which bands you follow or have liked, and it suggests music to listen to.

-Alternativly, the user can use the genere based search engine to find bands/artists.

-Music creators and professionals can upload their music and share it to music groups and external social networks.

-Featured on every audio is a play count,share count,download count,comment box,like count and add to playlist button.

######What is unique about it?

The ability to search for music on a genre basis.

######Where are you currently in the design process?

I have done most of the wireframes so I want to start on the actual interface design.
