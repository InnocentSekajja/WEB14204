###Interviewing Humans



When I did my interview for the music app, I was at first nervous because I had never met these people before. Also the fact that I never had a finished product made me feel like I might not get the people I was supposed to interview excited enough to want to talk.
Since the people I interviewed were my sister's friends and work colleagues, I asked my sister to ask them a little about their personal and professional life before they come to interview with me so that I could have an icebreaker for the interview. An example of this is one of the two people I interviewed was an active member of a gym so I asked her what motivated her to join a gym and what benefits have come out of it. Since I had taken time to get to know a little about the interviewees, it created for a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere.

I firstly introduced my app and gave them a breakdown of how it would work theoretically. I explained to them that at this stage these were just wire frames and a concept of the actual app that I wanted to get their opinion on. I told them their was no right or wrong answer and that I was going to take the information they provided me with and use it to improve my interface design. I believe that this set the tone of the interview.

I had bullet points of what I wanted to ask so as to help me stay on topic. This was especially helpful seeing that the interviewees were curious about my course and were asking me questions about it. So the bullet points at hand helped me steer the interview back to its intended topic which was the music app. 

I gave the interviewees time to talk and tried not to interrupt or rush them for an answer.

In conclusion, I thanked them for taking time out of their day to come and do an interview with me and I wrapped up the interview. 

I then took the data I had collected and analysed it for recurring patterns and main points. Finally, I narrowed down the interview by bullet pointing the answers and questions.

What could have been better was if I had a much more finished looking interface design because I feel I could have gotten a lot more information if that was the case.

What is most challenging about interviewing people is the fact of expecting the unexpected. The interviewer doesn't know what direction the interviewee may take the interview. This is especially impactful in a video recorded interview.

I was surprised that my interviewees were actually kin on the subject matter at hand and they were curious about whether I was actually going to develop this app and commercialise it.
