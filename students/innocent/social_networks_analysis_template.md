### Audience(s)

######Soundcloud

Its mainly for artists/musicians both amature and professional but it has a social network element to it where the users can comment on the audio. This enables funs to interract with their favourite musicains hence making for a much more enjoyable music social network. Users can subscribe to their favourite artists and get updates whenever an artist posts a new song. Users can also share a song they like on soundcloud and other social networks. People can create groups for their favourite genres of music and followers of that group can share music from other artists into the group. Artists can also directly share their music into these groups but sometimes they need admin clearence from the admin of the group.

######Tastebuds

This is a social  network which links people together based on musical taste. The network mainly focuses on the social aspect of making friends through music.

######Reverbnation

This is mainly for musicains only. Due to the lack of the social element, its difficult for muscicains on this site to increase their fun base.
### Relationship(s)

######What kind of relationships (aka *ties*) can users (aka *nodes*) establish in the network? 

follow,share,like,comments.

######What are the steps to connect (and disconnect)? What are these actions called (see *content definition* below)?

follow/unfollow

#### Reciprocity

######How do people *reciprocate* the relationships they establish on these networks? For example on Facebook you have to reciprocate (ie "I am your friend and you are my friend"), on Twitter you don't ("You follow me, but I don't follow you")

People can reciprocate by following back.

#### Homophily

######To what extent do people form ties with similar versus dissimilar others? Similarity can be defined by gender, race, age, occupation, educational achievement, status, values, geographic proximity..

People create groups for their favourite music and the groups may require admin clearance to join or share music. 

### Content(s)

######What kind of content(s) are users producing, sharing and consuming on these networks?

music and podcasts

### Currency

######What do people *exchange* on the networks you chose?

######For examples, `likes` are the currency on [Instagram](http://instagram.com), `retweets` and `followers` are [Twitter](https://twitter.com)'s currencies.

### Content definition

######How are things called in your chosen social networks?

######Is it `friends` or `contacts` or `buddies` or ... ?

######Is it `like` or `love` or `appreciate` or `agree` or `+1` or ... ? 

likes,followers

######And what implications could those choice of words have? For example, how do you `like` a post about a missing cat, or someone's death? Are all your connections really `friends`?

since its mainly audio being posted on the network, It makes sense to "like" so its not awkward.

The connections are funs and not friends.

######In particular, consider the **calls to action** (eg: `Buy this`, `Sign up today`, `Follow me`, `Send`, `Post` etc), which are usually found in buttons. What are your competitors asking users to do?

buy,download,follow,share

### Onboarding

######User *onboarding* is the process of increasing the likelihood that *new users* adopt your product and keep using it.

######How do your chosen social networks onboard new users?

######See these very good analyses of slightly confusing user onboarding: [Instagram](http://www.useronboard.com/how-instagram-onboards-new-users/) and [SnapChat](http://www.useronboard.com/how-snapchat-onboards-new-users/)

By suggesting artists to follow depending on your musical taste.

### Blank slate

> I just signed up, what do I do now?

######Your app may feel without life and empty before the user has started to enter data into it. This is an opportunity to motivate the user to start using the app, by showing examples (sample content, screenshots) and best practices (seeds).

######How do your chosen social networks deal with blank slates? How do they set the tone?

[More about blank slates here](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns/BlankSlate).

Soundcloud immediately shows brings up artists from a genre that the user has chosen so there is an immediate sense of excitement.
