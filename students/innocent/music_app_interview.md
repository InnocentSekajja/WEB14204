####MUSIC APP INTERVIEW (first interview with my workmate)

######What do you think the images are about?

Andrezza: I think the images are about some sort of web page.

######What kind of web page?

Andrezza: socializing network focused page because of the followings and likes.

######It is a music app and it does have a social element to it. Have you used a music app before?

Andrezza: Besides the internet radio app, no not really.

######Have you uploaded photos,music or video on Facebook before?

Andrezza: Yes, I do upload some videos of funny social outings but I would say I upload more photos than I do video.
 
######Using the same mind set you would use when uploading photos onto Facebook, look at the images in front of you and see if you could find out how to upload music onto the app?

Andrezza: Ok,on the profile page, it does instruct people to click upload to create content.

######How do you find new music?

Andrezza: Well, I am guessing by using the search function at the top.

######How do you create  a playlist?

Andrezza: By clicking on playlist.

######Were you not sure or confused about anything on the app?

Andrezza: I thought is was a social network like Facebook.

######If you could, what would you add to the app?

Andrezza: A wish list. For example if there was music for a certain artist that wasn't on the app, I would add them to a wish list so that if someone uploads that artists music, the app can send me an alert.
