##Endowment Effect
I agree that people tend to have a sense of attachment to things once they have used them and they tend to find it difficult to transition to a similar product offering the same value or service.

I think I could use this in my app especially through the profile page customization. Letting people  have a certain degree of customization will create a sense of ownership hence giving them an incentive to want to continue using the app and not get distracted by what similar apps are offering.
