####THE INTERVIEW (AVAILABLE AT A BOOKSHOP NEAR YOU, GET IT BEFORE IT SELLS OUT!!!!!!!!!!)

######Are there factors that influence the type of music you listen to, if so can you describe them?

Karella: it depends on what mood i am in, if I am in a happy mood, I tend to listen to a lot of uptempo music like pop and if I am in a not so good mood, I tend to listen to slow ballads.

Jethro: I depends on what I am doing. If I am going to or coming from work, I tend to listen to listen to r&b music well as if I am home or relaxing, I find myself listening to mostly rap music.

######How would you describe your process of listening to and discovering new music?

Karella: I mostly discover new music on the internet and television although sometimes I discover it on the radio.

Jethro: I also discover my music on the internet particularly Youtube but also from TV adverts, programmes and films.

######What are the advantages and disadvantages of the process your are currently using to discover new music?

Karella: The advantages with discovering music online is that it is instant i.e. there is no waiting as the music is already on the web. Disadvantages of internet music is that it is limited to WIFI or 4G networks if one is to enjoy it to the maximum.

The disadvantages of discovering music on the radio is that you are restricted to what the radio presenter is playing and do not have any power over what to listen to

Jethro: I agree with Karella regards to the advantages of discovering music online however it also encourages music piracy so musicians don't get the worth of their music financially.

I would also say radio tends to play the same songs repeatedly hence it doesn't give room for newer artists on the airwaves.

######If you had the power to improve the way you discover new music, what would you do?

Karella: Music websites should have forums/blog posts that discuss new music.
Also, a subscription function that sends out newsletters introducing new music to its users.

Jethro: Listeners having the ability to rate music on music websites.
Websites that show new music in genre categories with release date information.

######What would influence you to go out of your way and purchase a piece of music whether be it online or in a record store?

Karella: If the music is cheap enough

Jethro: If its an album I could see myself listening to 5 years from now
