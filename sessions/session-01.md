# Week 1

## Today, Tuesday 6th January 2015

1. Unit intro: [plan](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14204#plan), key dates, [brief](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14204#brief) and [assessment criteria](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14204#assessment-criteria) 
* What is User eXperience?
* Come up with 3 product ideas and write about them.


# What is UX?

* UX design is about effectively addressing the **needs** and **circumstances** of your **users**, to produce **interfaces** that are **comfortable** and even **joyful** to use.

* There are many definitions for User eXperience. [Here](http://www.allaboutux.org/ux-definitions) is a pool of definitions found from the literature and on the Web. We can start thinking about UX from this image

* **User-centred** approach (*user personas*) vs **activity-centred** approach (*user stories*). We'll do a bit of both.


## What is a prototype? How do we get there?

* Prototypes answer **questions** (the more specific the better).

* Prototypes stand between your ideas (**assumptions**) and your users (**behaviours**)

* Prototypes should be quick (and **cheap**) to make, re-make and possibly discard.

* Prototype should be **close** to the real thing

* We'll start with sketches on paper (**paper-prototypes**), and then move on to **HTML prototypes** (design in the browser)


## Why mobile-first?

* Embrace the diversity of devices people are accessing the internet from

* Starting from the small screens (and less capable hardware) makes you focus on what really matters

* Give yourself a performance budget (how much can this page weigh on a mobile phone? how long should it take to load on a 3G connection?)



# Product ideas

Start by reading [Interfaces in need](https://medium.com/@gbks/interfaces-in-need-fa21105102c6) and [A guide to unsolicited redesigns](http://www.welcomebrand.co.uk/thoughts/the-designers-guide-to-unsolicited-redesigns/)

Your task is to **come up with 3 product ideas** and write about them in [this collaborative Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uvH4DzJyyMGLhlRfwow58k96xDwcw6ZX--RoUhqB928/edit?usp=sharing) (start today, refine by next week)

## How do I generate ideas?

If you want to have **good ideas** you must [have **many ideas**](https://medium.com/founder-stories/9bd554bedce0).

**Most** of them will be **wrong**, and what you have to learn is which ones to throw away. This is why we're asking you to come up with at least 3, so that one should be half-decent :)

* Jot down as many ideas as possible 
* There are no *bad* ideas 
* Put stray ideas to one side 
* Donâ€™t stay too long on one idea
* Avoid multi-tasking (can you put your phone away for say 30 minutes?)
